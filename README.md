## My process

### Built with

-HTMl5
-CSS

### What I learned

This is the part I'm the most proud of because it took sooooo long to get the shadow down and even then I needed help.

```box-shadow: 4px 8px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on using shadows to add depth to boxes on porjects, I feel that mastering that can really add to any website.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube] It wasn't any one video just some on shadowing and centering the card.
